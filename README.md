# Wafer Fault Detection Machine Learning Project :gear::chart_with_upwards_trend:

The aim of this project is to develop an automated sensor fault detection system for Scania trucks that can identify and diagnose sensor faults in real-time. The system should be able to detect faults in a wide range of sensors, including those used to monitor engine performance, fuel efficiency, and safety features. The goal is to improve the overall reliability and safety of Scania trucks by quickly identifying and addressing sensor faults, reducing the risk of accidents and downtime caused by equipment failure.. :factory::rocket:

## Project Overview :clipboard:

This project involves several key processes to achieve accurate and efficient wafer fault detection:

1. **Data Collection** :file_folder::mag_right:: Relevant data, including wafer characteristics, sensor readings, and historical fault data, is collected from the semiconductor manufacturing process. This data serves as the foundation for building the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing** :wrench::gear:: The collected data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Missing values are handled, outliers are detected, and data normalization or scaling techniques are applied to ensure the data is in a suitable format for training the machine learning model.

3. **Feature Engineering** :toolbox::hammer:: The most relevant features are selected and transformed from the collected data. Dimensionality reduction techniques may be employed, and new features may be created to enhance the model's ability to detect faults effectively.

4. **Model Selection** :bar_chart::1234:: The appropriate machine learning algorithm is chosen for the fault detection task. Common algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, or anomaly detection methods.

5. **Model Training** :computer::brain:: The selected machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed data. During training, the model learns the patterns and relationships between features and fault occurrences.

6. **Model Evaluation** :chart_with_upwards_trend::clipboard:: The performance of the trained model is assessed using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. This step helps gauge how well the model can detect faults on new, unseen data.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning** :gear::hammer_and_wrench:: The model's hyperparameters are fine-tuned to optimize its performance. This process involves conducting experiments to find the best combination of hyperparameter values.

8. **Model Deployment** :rocket::package:: The trained model is integrated into the manufacturing process or quality control system. The deployed model continuously monitors incoming wafer data and flags potential faults for further inspection.

9. **Real-time Fault Detection** :alarm_clock::crystal_ball:: The deployed model operates in real-time, analyzing data from the manufacturing process as wafers are being processed. The model identifies deviations or anomalies that could indicate potential faults.

10. **Monitoring and Maintenance** :bar_chart::wrench:: The performance of the deployed model is regularly monitored and updated as needed to ensure its effectiveness over time. Continuous improvement and retraining with new data are essential to keep the model up-to-date and accurate.
